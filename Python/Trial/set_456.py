# . Identify if a Number is Positive or Negative 
# Write a Python program that takes a number as input and determines whether it is 
# positive or negative. 

# # Get input from the user
# num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# # Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero
# if num > 0:
#     print("The number is positive.")
# elif num < 0:
#     print("The number is negative.")
# else:
#     print("The number is zero.")

# 2
#  Identify if a Number is Even or Odd 
# Write a Python program that takes a number as input and checks whether it is even or 
# odd. 

# # Get input from the user
# num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# # Check if the number is even or odd
# if num % 2 == 0:
#     print("The number is even.")
# else:
#     print("The number is odd.")

# Calculate the Power of a Number 
# Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input: 
# ● The first number represents the base. 
# ● The second number represents the exponent. 
# Compute and display the result of raising the base to the exponent. 
# Example Input: 
# 5   
# 2   
# Example Output:  2 5  

## ans

# # Get input from the user
# base = float(input("Enter the base number: "))
# exponent = float(input("Enter the exponent: "))

# # Calculate the power
# result = base ** exponent

# # Display the result
# print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}")
